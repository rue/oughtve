 To Do
=======

- Improve command parser. Running out of letters. Complicated.
  Maybe just subparsers for each action.

- Improve synch or "feed" capabilities through the JSON or YAML
  output, probably initially by including the IDs although just
  the timestamp may be enough anyway.

- Separate into entry, view, manage scripts.

- Delete orphaned Chapters and Verses.

- Change the stupid names.

- Allow changing the default path/name so that multiple binaries
  could exist for shorthand.

- Write some Tap tasks for specs &c.
